 Hi, Iâ€™m @carloslinsba. 

I have a strong formal education and more than 10 years of hands-on experience in developing software systems, MVPs, proof of concepts and coordinating teams.  
PhD at University of Twente (CS top 70 universities). Interested in challenging and engaging projects.

In my academic research I mainly worked with conceptual models, ontologies,semantic web technologies and EA.  I received two best paper awards (2011 and 2015) and (indirectly) contributed to change the international pattern language 'ArchiMate' from 'The Open Group' in its Motivation Elements (2013) and its Strategic Elements (2017).
