 Hi, Iâ€™m @carloslinsba. 

I am a software developer.

I have a graduation at Computer Science from UFES (Brazil - 2009), a master's degree at Computer Science from UFES (Brazil - 2012) and a Ph.D. at Computer Science from the University of Twente (The Netherlands - 2017).

As of 2018 onwards I've decided to 'increase and recicle my knowledge' in AI and ML, coordinating and participating in research projects using ML in:
- Health care ( 'predicting and screening commom mental disorders' in the general population (2018-onwards)); 
- Agriculture ('To assess the quality of Pink-Pepper crops'.  We're using regular photographs of the crop in order to do so (2021 - onwards) );

As of 2022 I've also decided to 'recicle my knowledge' in back-end, including Python and related technologies such as Flask, Django and REST API. I also work with JavaScript and Node.js.
This GitHub is related to this latter tasks.

In my academic research I mainly worked with conceptual models, ontologies,semantic web technologies and EA.  I received two best paper awards (2011 and 2015) and (indirectly) contributed to change the international pattern language 'ArchiMate' from 'The Open Group' in its Motivation Elements (2013) and its Strategic Elements (2017).
